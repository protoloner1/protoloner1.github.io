  <h2>Happy Valentine’s Day, My Bubu❤️</h2>
  
  <p>Rupali….</p>
  
  <p>I want to tell you all this stuff that’s always in my heart… today and every day.</p>
  
  <p>Every morning when I wake up… the first thing I think about is you…. and every night when I’m falling asleep… it’s still you in my head…. every single day is like that.</p>
  
  <p>Ever since you came into my life… I’ve changed a lot… for the better. I stopped drinking…. stopped smoking…. stopped weeds too…. all of it, because of you. You make me want to be a better person.</p>
  
  <p>You mean everything to me…. my life…. my soul…. my world…. my everything.</p>
  
  <p>I just want to take away all your pain…. I never want anything bad to happen to you… my bubu... that’s all I pray for.</p>
  
  <p>And I’m really sorry…. for anything wrong I ever said or did…. for any hurt I caused…. please forgive me from your heart my baby.</p>
  
  <p>It kills me inside when you’re irresponsible with yourself…. when you put yourself down…. when you feel insecure…. it hurts me so much to see that.</p>
  
  <p>You’re perfect…. perfect in every way…. you’re my lifeline…. you’re my bubu.</p>
  
  <p>I’ll always be right here beside you…. forever….</p>
  
  <p>I just want you to be happy always…. forever…. I want to see you smile…. laugh with your whole heart…. no holding back…. I want you to feel confident in yourself…. because you really are that amazing.</p>
  
  <p>I love you…. so much… my baby.</p>
  
  <p class="big-heart">Your Dudu ❤️❤️❤️</p>
